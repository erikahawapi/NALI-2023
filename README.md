# NALI 2023
NALI 2023 at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia showcased innovative projects to enhance student engagement and cognitive abilities, fostering excitement for learning. It provided valuable insights into innovative teaching methods and technology, positively impacting students' academic and professional skills.

To make NALI 2023 more interesting, the organizers could consider more interactive sessions such as workshops, roundtable discussions, and breakout sessions to encourage active participation and engagement from attendees.

Overall, my experience at NALI 2023 was truly enriching as I had the opportunity to explore a wide range of knowledge during the collaborative sharing event.
